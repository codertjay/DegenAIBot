## Features

- Fetches Solana blockchain transactions for a given wallet address.
- Calculates the PNL based on the transaction details.
- Fetches historical token prices from CoinGecko.
- Tweets the PNL and portfolio summary using the Twitter API.
- Scheduled tasks using cron jobs.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.19 or later
- A Solana wallet address
- CoinStats API key
- Twitter API credentials
